In this assignment, I added comment feature on day detail of the workout. 
The comments entered for specific day is only displayed within that day. Also the comments can be scrolled to bottom and top.
The comment items can delted by user on next to comment message inside the comment card.
As seen in the figure structure contains the "Start Training" button and the comment section which includes list of comments and input section.
The Room Database is used to collect and store the comments within the id, dayIndex and message columns.
In the main menu when we delete the account, all comments in our experince are deleted and user can add comments with new account.
